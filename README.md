rocket-matter-builder
=====================

Level editor for the [rocket-matter game](https://github.com/timothyschofield/rocket-matter/)

[See demo of game](http://rocket-matter.azurewebsites.net/)

After creating a level for the game, save the world in file "rocket-matter.js" and place it in the root of the rocket-matter game together with index.html.

The black rectangle represents the position of the rocket at the beginning of the game. This can be moved. Blocks can be created as regular (red) blocks or as static blocks (grey) which cannot be move during the game. Move blocks in the game builder by selecting them with the cursor and then using the cursor control points. Delete blocks by selecting them with the cursor and then either clicking the "delete block" button or hitting the delete key.
